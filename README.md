# ᓚᘏᗢ Noodles HATES your playlist

> “I’ve heard better music coming from the blender.” – **Noodles**, probably.

![Noodles excited to judge your playlist](pictures/git.gif)

🎧 A brutally honest, visually charming(as much as i could make it), and unapologetically judgmental Spotify playlist analyzer built in Python.  
This app lets my music-snob cat **Noodles** roast your musical taste, because what’s self-awareness without a little digital humiliation that too by an orange cat?

## 🚀 What It Does

Noodles dives into your Spotify playlist, pulls the data, and presents:

- 🎤 **Top Artists** (in a snarky pie chart)
- 🎧 **Top Genres** (accompanied by bar charts and judgment)
- 🧠 **Playlist Personality** (based on your top genres—prepare to be read for filth)
- 🔥 **AI-generated roasts** personalized by **Cohere AI**
- 🎶 [Still working on it...] **Noodles-approved recommendations** based on your vibe
